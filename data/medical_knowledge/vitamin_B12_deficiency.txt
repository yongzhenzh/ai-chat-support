Vitamin B12 deficiency is a condition where your body doesn't have enough vitamin B12, an essential nutrient needed for healthy nerve cells, blood cells, and DNA synthesis. It can lead to various physical, neurological, and psychological symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, memory problems, and a sore tongue. Causes include inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption issues like pernicious anemia or certain gastrointestinal disorders, surgery affecting the digestive tract, or long-term use of certain medications. Vitamin B12 deficiency can be diagnosed with a blood test to measure vitamin B12 levels and is typically treated with vitamin B12 supplements, often in the form of injections or high-dose oral medications.
