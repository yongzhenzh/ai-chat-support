Hypertension, commonly referred to as high blood pressure, describes a condition where the force of blood against the inner walls of the arteries remains elevated over time. This increased pressure compels the heart to work harder to circulate blood throughout the body. Sustained high blood pressure can pose serious risks, potentially leading to significant health complications such as heart attack and stroke if it is not properly managed. Blood pressure is assessed using two values: systolic pressure, the measurement taken when the heart contracts, and diastolic pressure, which reflects the pressure in the arteries while the heart is at rest between beats. A typical threshold for diagnosing hypertension is a reading of 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater. High blood pressure can develop gradually without a specific known cause, known as primary hypertension, or it can be a consequence of another underlying medical condition or medication, which is termed secondary hypertension. Many individuals with hypertension experience no noticeable symptoms, even when their blood pressure reaches unhealthy levels, which is why it is often called the "silent killer." However, in cases of very high blood pressure, some people may experience symptoms such as headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds. Diagnosis involves a healthcare professional taking multiple blood pressure readings, and management strategies often include lifestyle adjustments like adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight, sometimes complemented by medication to help control blood pressure and minimize the risk of related health issues.
