Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a general term encompassing various conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, with coronary artery disease (CAD) being the most prevalent type and the leading cause of death in the United States. CAD occurs when plaque builds up in the heart arteries, restricting blood flow and potentially leading to heart attacks. Other types of heart disease include arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), heart failure, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), and congenital heart defects. Symptoms can range from none to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling, and risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and stress can increase the likelihood of developing heart disease. However, many heart disease risk factors can be controlled or prevented through lifestyle changes and medical management, and it's essential to seek professional guidance if you have concerns or experience symptoms.
