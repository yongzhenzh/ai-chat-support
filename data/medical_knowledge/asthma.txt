Asthma is a persistent respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing. Individuals with asthma may experience coughing, particularly at night, a whistling sound called wheezing when exhaling, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. These symptoms can be triggered by various factors, including allergens like pollen or dust mites, respiratory infections, exercise, and exposure to cold air or pollutants. While there is no cure, asthma is manageable with appropriate medications, such as those used for long-term control to reduce inflammation and quick-relief inhalers to address sudden symptom flare-ups, in conjunction with minimizing exposure to identified triggers and following a personalized asthma action plan developed in consultation with a healthcare professional.
