Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body has difficulty regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels, either due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective use of the insulin it does produce, leading to high blood sugar that can damage various organs over time. There are different types, including Type 1 where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells, requiring daily insulin, and Type 2, the most common type, where the body doesn't use insulin efficiently, often linked to lifestyle factors like being overweight or inactive. Symptoms can include increased thirst and urination, fatigue, blurry vision, and slow-healing sores, while long-term complications can affect the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. Managing diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar, lifestyle changes like healthy eating and exercise, and potentially medication or insulin therapy to control blood sugar levels and prevent serious health problems.
