Depression, or major depressive disorder, is a common and serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, which can significantly affect how you feel, think, and handle daily life. Symptoms can include low mood, fatigue, changes in appetite and sleep, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and even thoughts of death or suicide. While the exact cause is unknown, it's believed to be a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Although depression is not typically cured permanently, it's highly treatable with therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy, and medication, which can effectively manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
