Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, making it difficult to distinguish reality. Symptoms can include hallucinations (like hearing voices), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized thinking and speech, and a decrease in motivation and emotional expression. The cause is unknown, but genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental factors are thought to play a role. While there's no cure, it's a treatable condition managed with antipsychotic medications, therapy like CBT and family therapy, and support, allowing individuals to lead fulfilling lives. Schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder.
