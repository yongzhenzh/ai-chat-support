Migraine is a complex neurological disorder characterized by moderate to severe headaches, often throbbing on one side of the head, and commonly associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. These attacks can last for hours to days and may be preceded by an aura, which can include temporary visual disturbances, tingling, or difficulty speaking. The exact cause is not fully understood, but it's believed to involve abnormal brain activity, possibly with genetic and environmental influences. While there's no cure, migraine is a manageable condition, treated with pain relief medications for acute attacks and preventative measures to reduce frequency and severity, often including lifestyle changes and prescription drugs.
